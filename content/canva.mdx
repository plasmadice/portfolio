## What is Canva?

With its simple drag-and-drop interface, [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) makes graphic design accessible to anyone. This post explores how Canvaâ€™s powerful features make it a great choice for both professionals and hobbyists.

Canva is a graphic design platform that allows users to create social media posts, presentations, posters, logos, and more. It has a vast library of templates and drag-and-drop tools to customize designs quickly.

## Features with users in mind

The key benefit of Canva is its simplicity. With an intuitive interface, anyone can create professional-looking graphics without prior design experience. The platform handles the technical aspects behind-the-scenes, allowing users to focus on being creative.

## My Experience Using Canva's Free Tier

I used Canva's free tier to recreate a JavaScript array methods cheatsheet with a Pacman theme. 

Canva has a library of graphics that are free for use. While Canva Pro offers more graphics, there were enough free icons, illustrations, and photos for my basic design. The hardest part was finding free Pacman SVGs to match my theme.

Once I had the assets, it took another minute to figure out how to use Canva's guides to align everything.

This quick project shows that Canva's free tier empowers anyone to create social graphics, resumes, flyers and more. While certain elements like premium fonts and graphics are paywalled, the core tools are available without paying.

## Canva vs Figma

Another popular graphic design tool is [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Figma offers more robust professional design features for UI/UX design and collaboration. For hobbyists and social media marketers, Canva provides enough features for free. 

Some important points:

- Figma has more advanced design tools and plugins, while Canva focuses on simplicity
- Figma's paid content is focused on team collaboration and plugins, while Canva keeps their best graphics behind a paywall
- Figma is focused on product design workflows, Canva on social media content



The two tools excel in different use cases. Canva empowers individual creators with an easy-to-use editor. Figma powers product teams with advanced design and prototyping features.  

## Pricing

Canva is also highly affordable compared to traditional design software like Adobe Illustrator.

- Canva Pro starts at $14.99/month
- Illustrator costs $20.99/mo for a single app license

Illustrator and Canva's target demographics overlap, but Canva has many features that help it stand out for users who post on social media.

## Conclusion

With its easy learning curve and decent free tier, Canva is sure to positively affect the next generation of graphic design. While advanced users may still prefer Illustrator, Canva is a great option for beginners looking to create social graphics, resumes, flyers, and more. Its simple interface empowers anyone to produce professional visual content.
