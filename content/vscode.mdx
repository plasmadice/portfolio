# How to Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Visual Studio Code, also known as VSCode, is a free and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It's a preferred tool for many programmers because of its wide range of supported languages, extensions, and robust debugging features. In this tutorial, we will walk you through how to install VSCode on your machine.

## Step 1: Download the VSCode Installer

The first step to installing VSCode is to download the installer.

- For **Windows** and **Linux** users, you can download the installer from the [VSCode Download Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
- For **Mac** users, you can download it from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/visual-studio-code/id1295253422) or the [VSCode Download Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Step 2: Run the Installer

Once the installer has been downloaded, you will need to run it to install VSCode.

### For Windows:

1. Navigate to your Downloads folder and double-click on the downloaded file.
2. Follow the prompts in the Setup Wizard.

### For Mac:

1. Open the downloaded `.zip` file.
2. Drag `Visual Studio Code.app` to the `Applications` folder.

### For Linux:

The process will vary depending on your distribution. For Debian/Ubuntu, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
sudo dpkg -i <file-name.deb>
```

Replace `<file-name.deb>` with the name of the downloaded file.

For RedHat/CentOS, use:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
sudo yum localinstall <file-name.rpm>
```

Replace `<file-name.rpm>` with the name of the downloaded file.

For Mac, you can find it in your Applications folder or launch it from Launchpad.

For Linux, you can find it in your Applications menu, or you can open it from the terminal using the code command.
