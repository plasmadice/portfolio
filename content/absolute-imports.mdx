summary: "Shorten your imports in TypeScript projects by using Absolute Imports instead of Relative Imports."
---

Today, let's cover a pretty simple, but useful feature of Node. You can do this in both JavaScript and TypeScript, but today we'll only cover TypeScript's implementation through `tsconfig.json`. 

Let's get started!

## How Imports Typically Work

By default, all imports are relative. Relative imports use the path from the current file to the target, **or** the path from the root of your directory to the target. Alternatively, you can set up absolute imports that will allow you to point to certain files or folders.

Relative imports are the by far the most common. They are also the most verbose. Let's look at an example.

<Flex>
```md title="The folder structure that caused this mess"
app
  api
    data
      [sortMethod]
        [quantity]
          route.ts
  types
    typeFile.d.ts
    index.ts 
```
</Flex>

```ts title="./app/api/data/[sortMethod]/[quantity]/route.ts"
import { MediaSort, AnimeResponse } from "../../../../types"
```

## First Off, Why?

I'm currently working on (yet another) Next.js project. This one has much more `/app` router action. [The folder structure dictates the routing of the application](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing), and so, absolute imports become very enticing as your project grows.

Simple imports from other parts of your app can start to look a little ridiculous. As you can see from above.

It's possible to use absolute imports to clean this up and make this a little more obvious.

```ts title="./app/api/data/[sortMethod]/[quantity]/route.ts"
import { MediaSort, AnimeResponse } from "@types"
```

**Much** easier on the eyes. Let's see how this is done.

## Setup

In your `tsconfig.json` file you will need to add a [`baseUrl`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#baseUrl) and the [`paths`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths) object. The `baseUrl` sets a base directory from which to resolve non-relative module names. While `paths` lets you map certain values to specific paths.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ˜±">Changing the `baseUrl` to anything other than `.` can cause your app to stop working if you're unsure what you're doing.</Callout>

`paths` is an object that basically contains abbreviations and paths in key:value pairs. Next.js includes the values below for convenience (if you select them during setup). They allow you to use `@` out of the box as a shortcut.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ... other options
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"],
    }
  },
  // ... other options
}
```

That's enough to save me tons of "effort" already.

```ts title="./app/api/data/[sortMethod]/[quantity]/route.ts"
import { MediaSort, AnimeResponse } from "@/app/types"
```

This is good. I could leave it right here and be satisfied. **Of course, that's not what I did**. 

## Adding More Paths

Some of my resources don't have the `index.ts` approach of importing all items in a folder into one file where they will be exported. Some of them require that I target the specific file or component. Thankfully, I know how to handle this. By creating more paths that will point directly to either the `index.ts` files **or** the folder, we use the wildcard pattern to allow us to specify imports as well.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ... other options
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"],
      "@types": ["./app/types/index.ts"],
      "@types/*": ["./app/types/*"],
      "@components": ["./app/components/index.ts"],
      "@components/*": ["./app/components/*"],
      "@hooks": ["./app/hooks/index.ts"],
      "@hooks/*": ["./app/hooks"],
      "@utils": ["./app/utils/index.ts"],
      "@utils/*": ["./app/utils/*"],
    }
  },
  // ... other options
}
```

With this, I will be able to turn my brain off when importing things. Win!

```ts title="./app/api/data/[sortMethod]/[quantity]/route.ts"
// '@types' = './app/types/index.ts'
import { MediaSort, AnimeResponse } from "@types"
```

```tsx title="./app/details/[id]/page.tsx"
// before
import ImageLoader from "../../components/ImageLoader"

// after
// '@components/ImageLoader' = './app/components/ImageLoader'
import ImageLoader from "@components/ImageLoader"
```

## Conclusion

This is a pretty simple feature, but it can also save you some time and effort. I'm all about that. While path intellisense has imporved immensely over the years, I still find myself wondering exactly where my assets are in relation to a file. This helps me to not have to think about it.

Hopefully this helps someone. Happy coding!
