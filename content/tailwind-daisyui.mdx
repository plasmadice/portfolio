Hello, fellow developers!

Today, let's delve into **TailwindCSS** and the power it provides us with as shorthand CSS. TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that empowers developers to build bespoke designs without leaving HTML.

<Image
  alt={`Tailwind CSS Logo`}
  src={`/images/blog/tailwind-daisyui-logo.png`}
  width={2900 / 2}
  height={2228 / 2}
/>

## Our Example

The avatar used on the [homepage]('/')

<Image
  alt={`avatar`}
  className="rounded-full grayscale"
  src={`/images/blog/avatar.png`}
  width={100}
  height={100}
  priority
/>

```jsx
<Image
  alt={`avatar`}
  className="rounded-full grayscale"
  src={`/images/blog/avatar.png`}
  width={100}
  height={100}
  priority
/>
```

Interestingly; the `placeholder="blur"` property does not work because it is missing a blurDataURL. That value should be automatically generated, but it is not.

```jsx
<Image
  alt={`avatar`}
  className="rounded-full grayscale"
  src={`/images/blog/avatar.png`}
  width={100}
  height={100}
  priority
/>
```

The benefits are manifold. It promotes consistency, increases productivity, and limits the size of your CSS.

Sometimes, you might need to override styles to customize designs. You can use the @apply directive, or extend your configuration file to include custom styles.

```jsx
<Image
  alt={`avatar`}
  className="rounded-full grayscale"
  src={`/images/blog/avatar.png`}
  width={100}
  height={100}
  priority
/>
```

Now, let's introduce DaisyUI, a plugin for TailwindCSS that provides beautiful UI components and widgets.

Overriding styles in DaisyUI is also straightforward, thanks to its deep customization capabilities. You can extend your TailwindCSS theme or use the daisy property in the DaisyUI theme.

That's it for now. Stay tuned for more exciting insights into the world of frontend technologies!
