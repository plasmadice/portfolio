Yo!

Today, let's examine **TailwindCSS** and how well it plays with MDX. 

## What is Tailwind?

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that enables developers to craft designs. It can create some hideous and inline-looking CSS but honestly it is awesome. If you are still on the fence you need to jump onto this side. Let's figure out what we don't know!

## What is MDX?

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a way to write JSX in Markdown. It allows you to use React components within Markdown files. This is a powerful combination that allows you to create interactive articles. 

It changes the game for developers who want to write. Not as much of a breakthrough as Blue's Clues or Dora the Explorer, but it's a start.

## Getting Tailwind Involved with MDX

Setting things up is easy. Make sure your `tailwind.config.js` file is picking up `.mdx` files. 

<Caption className="w-full" value="This is the first and last time you'll see this much blank space in a code block">
```js title="./tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./content/**/*.mdx",
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
}
```
</Caption>

## Utility For Days

I don't particularly enjoy how the above code block fills the container horizontally. Going forward, I'll use `<Flex></Flex>` and `<Grid></Grid>` helpers to prevent code blocks from filling the containers they are in.

<Flex>
  ```tsx title="./components/mdx.tsx"
  function Flex(props) {
    return (
      <div className={
        `flex${props.className ? ` ${props.className}` : ""}`
        }>
        {props.children}
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```
</Flex>

## Example of MDX

We'll use the avatar on the [homepage]('/') for reference. It has some styling applied already.

<Caption value="<Flex> can also put elements on the same line ☝️">
  <Flex>
    <Image
      alt={`avatar`}
      src={`/images/blog/avatar.png`}
      className="rounded-full grayscale w-auto h-1/2"
      width={100}
      height={100}
      priority
    />
    ```jsx title="./app/page.tsx"
    <Image
      alt={`avatar`}
      src={`/images/blog/avatar.png`}
      className="rounded-full grayscale"
      width={100}
      height={100}
      {/* placeholder="blur" */}
      priority
    />
    ```
  </Flex>
</Caption>

Interestingly, the `placeholder="blur"` property doesn't work in MDX. It throws an error about a missing blurDataURL. This value [should be automatically generated](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#blurdataurl), but it isn't.

## Looking at the TypeScript

Creating custom components within this system is pretty straightforward. [leerob](https://leerob.io/) set things up such that there is an `mdx.tsx` file where you can import components for use. Components are **not** included by default.

Here's the code for the `Image` component after I made a change to how props are handled. It is exported later under the name `Image` for use.

<Caption value='"Interesting" pattern used to prevent props from overwriting'>
  <Flex>
  ```tsx title="./components/mdx.tsx"
  import Image from "next/image"

  function CustomImage({
    className,
    ...otherProps
  }: React.ComponentProps<typeof Image>) {
    return (
      <Image
        className={
          className?.includes("rounded")
            ? className
            : `rounded-lg${className ? ` ${className}` : ""}`
        }
        {...otherProps}
      />
    )
  }

  // ...
  const components = {
    Image: CustomImage,
    // ...
  }
  ```
  </Flex>
</Caption>

## Tailwind Plugins
Even plugins like DaisyUI work with no mdx-specific setup. Here is the DaisyUI [avatar with ring](https://daisyui.com/components/avatar/#avatar-with-ring).

<Caption value="These are custom figcaptions btw 😼">
<div className="avatar">
  <div className="w-24 rounded-full ring ring-primary ring-offset-base-100 ring-offset-2">
    <Image src="/images/blog/avatar.png" width={100} height={100} className="my-0" alt="avatar with daisy ui ring style" />
  </div>
</div>
</Caption>
```jsx
<Caption value="These are custom figcaptions btw 😼">
  <div className="avatar">
    <div className="w-24 rounded-full ring ring-primary ring-offset-base-100 ring-offset-2">
      <Image
        src="/images/blog/avatar.png"
        width={100}
        height={100}
        className="my-0"
        alt="avatar with daisy ui ring style"
      />
    </div>
  </div>
</Caption>
```

## Conclusion

Combining Next.js with MDX and TailwindCSS forms a potent combination. I was looking forward to cloning and dissecting this project to understand how to bring React components into articles. I'm quite satisfied with the outcome.
