## Introduction

I’ve always been curious about cybersecurity, but the field requires so much knowledge that it can be intimidating. After finishing Udacity’s Web Developer Nanodegree in 2018, I’m taking on the Ethical Hacker Nanodegree. 

I tried the Kotlin Android Nanodegree before and couldn’t finish, but I learned a lot. Now I’m ready for something new.

## The Story So Far

The Web Developer Nanodegree was tough but fun, teaching me solid front-end skills. I'm now intent on staying up-to-date with what's happening on the front-end. 

On the other hand.... the Kotlin Android Nanodegree didn’t pan out. However, it showed me where I struggled. Both experiences made me more determined to improve.

## Embracing Ethical Hacking

The Ethical Hacker Nanodegree focuses on network tests, secure coding, and more. It feels good to improve my own skill with a keyboard. Honestly, I've spent too many years chained to Windows.

## Getting Ready

I was lucky enough to get accepted into the program. I picked up [**Linux Basics For Hackers**](https://kea.nu/files/textbooks/humblesec/linuxbasicsforhackers.pdf) to brush up on my Linux skills. It’s helpful, but just a start. Real growth will happen when I dive into the course and tackle hands-on projects.

## What I Want to Achieve

I want a deeper understanding of how to keep systems secure. Even if I don’t break into the field, I’ll at least know how to customize and protect my own environment.
