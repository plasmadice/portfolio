Yo! My name is <b>Herman</b>, and I'm a <b>Software Engineer</b> who loves modern web technologies. I specialize in using cutting-edge technologies such as <b>Next.js</b> and <b>Tailwind CSS</b>, mostly focusing on frontend development.

I am incredibly excited to share my journey with you through this blog. As an eternal optimist, I always look for the silver lining, even in the most challenging coding problems. However, I also understand the importance of being realistic about the strengths and weaknesses of the tools and technologies we use.

This blog is powered by <b>MDX</b>, a markdown format that integrates with JSX. Meaning I can use react components in blog posts, bringing an added layer of interactivity. I'm hype for the potential of incorporating interactive elements like live code editors, embedded demos, and more. I hope to leverage this in upcoming posts, making them more engaging and hands-on.

In this blog, you can expect to see posts about my experiences with <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>Next.js</b>, and <b>Tailwind</b>. I'll be sharing my thoughts, insights, tips, and tricks that I've picked up along the way. My goal is to provide valuable content that can help you on your development journey.

This is not my first blog, but nonetheless I hope to have fun with this project. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge, and I look forward to contributing to the development community. Stay tuned for more!

Until next time, <b>happy coding</b>!
