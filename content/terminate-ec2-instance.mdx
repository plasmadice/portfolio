I've been digging into AWS a LOT lately. The best way to learn something is to get your hands dirty. This is a quick guide on how to find and terminate EC2 instances using the AWS CLI v2.

<Callout>
This guide assumes that you already have the AWS CLI installed and configured. If you don't, check out [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).

## Finding EC2 Instances

To list all your EC2 instances, you can use the describe-instances command:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,State.Name,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value[]]' --output table
```

<Image

width={1000}
height={700}
className="-auto"
/>

This command returns a table that lists the Instance IDs, their current states, and their associated Name tags.

## Terminating an EC2 Instance

<Callout emoji="❗">Be advised that terminating an EC2 instance is an irreversible action that cannot be undone. Please be careful when using this command.</Callout>

Once you identify the EC2 instance that you wish to terminate, note down its InstanceId. To terminate an instance, you use the terminate-instances command:


```bash
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
```

<Image

src={`/images/blog/terminate-ec2-2.png`}
width={1000}
height={700}
className="-auto"
/>

Replace i-1234567890abcdef0 with the actual InstanceId of the EC2 instance you wish to terminate. After you run the command, the instance will start to shut down.

## Check your work

It may take a moment for the instance to fully terminate. You can check the status of the instance by running the describe-instances command again:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,State.Name,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value[]]' --output table
```

## Conclusion

That's it! You now know how to find and terminate EC2 instances using the AWS CLI v2.
