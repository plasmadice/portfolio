## Advent of Code: Daily Warmups with TypeScript

This year, I’ve been diving into **Advent of Code 2024** as my daily brain warmup. It’s a fantastic way to start the day, solving puzzles that range from “oh, that’s clever” to “why am I doing math at 7 AM?” 

I’ve set up some **basic scaffolding** in TypeScript for each new day, so I can jump straight into the logic without getting bogged down in boilerplate. It’s been smooth sailing so far, and I love how it’s helping me sharpen my problem-solving skills one challenge at a time.

If you’re curious, you can check out my solutions here: [Advent of Code 2024 Solutions](https://github.com/plasmadice/advent-of-code-2024). Here's a preview of my day 1 solution in TypeScript:

```tsx title="src/day01/index.ts"
import { readInput, quickSort } from '@src/utils';

function solve(input: string[]): any {
  let total = 0
  let l: number[] = []
  let r: number[] = []

  input
    .forEach((line) => {
      let [left, right] = line.split('  ')
      l.push(parseInt(left))
      r.push(parseInt(right))
    })

  let sortedL = quickSort(l)
  let sortedR = quickSort(r)

  for (let i = 0; i < sortedL.length; i++) {
    if (sortedL[i] && sortedR[i]) {
      total += Math.abs(sortedL[i] - sortedR[i])
    }
  }
  
  return total
}

// Measure performance of the solution
const start = performance.now()
let result = solve(readInput(__dirname))
const end = performance.now()
console.log(result, `\nOperation took ${(end - start).toFixed(3)} milliseconds`);
```

## Advent of No Code: Creative Chaos

On the flip side, **Advent of No Code 2024** has been a playground for creativity. Each challenge is an opportunity to explore no-code tools and see what kind of wild, meme-y projects I can whip up. So far, I’ve leaned into the absurd, like making a Tic Tac Toe game where **AMD always wins** and designing a synthwave piano inspired by Gene’s piano from *Bob’s Burgers*.

Here’s a quick rundown of my submissions so far:

Each project has pushed me to think outside the box (and occasionally inside the meme), all while learning how these platforms handle unique challenges.

## Why Both?

Doing both Advent of Code and Advent of No Code has been the perfect balance of technical and creative challenges. **Advent of Code** gets my mind into problem-solving mode for the day, while **Advent of No Code** is a sandbox for experimenting with tools and ideas I wouldn’t usually explore.

If you’re up for it, I highly recommend giving either (or both!) a shot. And if you want to see what I’ve been building, my repository has all the details: [Advent of Code 2024 Solutions](https://github.com/plasmadice/advent-of-code-2024).

## Conclusion

Whether it’s debugging TypeScript at dawn or crafting a synthwave piano masterpiece by dusk, this year’s advent challenges have been a blast. I’m learning, creating, and having way too much fun along the way. 

Let me know if you’re doing any advent challenges too—I’d love to see what you’re building!
