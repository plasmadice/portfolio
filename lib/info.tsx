    <>
      I'm a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with extensive experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and API development. Notable achievements include automating healthcare processes at Olive AI, reducing manual work by over 100 hours monthly, and accelerating a Flash conversion project at Carley Corporation by six months. Recently, I successfully implemented the new version (V2) of Glossiâ€™s app, leading to a full-time position as a full-stack developer.
